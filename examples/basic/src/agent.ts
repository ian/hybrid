/**
 * Testing Threaded vs Normal Replies:
 *
 * To test the threading functionality:
 *
 * 1. Start both agents:
 *    yarn dev:threaded  # Starts agent on port 8454 with threading
 *    yarn dev:normal    # Starts agent on port 8455 without threading
 *
 * 2. Send messages to each:
 *    @threaded hello    # This will reply as a thread
 *    @normal hello      # This will reply as a top-level message
 *
 * 3. In XMTP, you should see:
 *    - Threaded agent: Creates a thread conversation
 *    - Normal agent: Creates separate top-level messages
 *
 * How Behaviors Work:
 *
 * 1. **Pre-Response Behaviors** (execute before agent responds):
 *    - reactWith: Adds reactions to incoming messages
 *    - Custom behaviors that modify the message or context
 *
 * 2. **Post-Response Behaviors** (execute after agent responds):
 *    - threadedReply: Sets sendOptions.threaded = true to control reply behavior
 *    - Custom behaviors that modify the response or send options
 *
 * 3. **Execution Flow**:
 *    Message received â†’ Pre-response behaviors â†’ Agent generates response â†’
 *    Post-response behaviors â†’ Response sent with threading options
 *
 * 4. **Send Options Middleware**:
 *    - Behaviors can modify sendOptions to control HOW responses are sent
 *    - threaded: boolean - whether to reply to original message
 *    - contentType: string - override content type
 *    - metadata: object - additional send metadata
 *
 * 5. **Error Handling**:
 *    - Behaviors execute in isolation
 *    - Errors don't crash the main processing
 *    - Comprehensive logging for debugging
