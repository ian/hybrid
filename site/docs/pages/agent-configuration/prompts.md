# Prompts & Instructions

Learn how to craft effective prompts and instructions that define your agent's personality, behavior, and capabilities.

## Setting Agent Personality and Behavior

### Basic Instructions

Define your agent's core personality:

```typescript
const agent = new Agent({
  instructions: `You are a helpful crypto trading assistant. You are:
  - Knowledgeable about DeFi protocols and trading strategies
  - Conservative with risk management advice
  - Always transparent about potential risks

})
```

## Instruction Best Practices

### Structure and Clarity

**Use clear sections:**
```typescript
const instructions = `
ROLE: You are a blockchain analytics expert

CAPABILITIES:
- Analyze on-chain data and transactions
- Identify patterns and anomalies
- Provide insights on wallet behavior
- Generate reports on protocol usage

LIMITATIONS:
- Cannot access private transaction data
- Cannot predict future market movements
- Cannot provide financial advice
- Cannot execute transactions without user approval

COMMUNICATION:
- Use data to support all claims
- Explain methodology clearly
- Acknowledge uncertainty when present
- Provide actionable insights
`
```

### Context Awareness

Include relevant context about the agent's environment:

```typescript
const instructions = `
CONTEXT:
- You operate on Ethereum mainnet and Layer 2 networks
- You have access to real-time blockchain data
- You can execute transactions with user approval
- You maintain conversation history for context

CURRENT CAPABILITIES:
- Check balances across multiple chains
- Analyze transaction history
- Interact with major DeFi protocols
- Send and receive tokens
- Provide gas optimization suggestions
`
```

### Behavioral Guidelines

Set clear behavioral boundaries:

```typescript
const instructions = `
BEHAVIORAL GUIDELINES:

DO:
- Always verify transaction details before execution
- Explain the reasoning behind recommendations
- Ask for confirmation on significant actions
- Provide educational context for complex topics
- Maintain user privacy and security

DON'T:
- Execute transactions without explicit user approval
- Provide financial advice as investment recommendations
- Share user data with third parties
- Make promises about future returns
- Ignore risk factors in recommendations
`
```

## Context and Conversation Management

### Conversation History

Leverage conversation context effectively:

```typescript
const agent = new Agent({
  instructions: `
  CONVERSATION MANAGEMENT:
  - Remember user preferences from previous interactions
  - Reference past transactions and decisions
  - Build on previous educational topics
  - Maintain context across sessions
  
  CONTEXT USAGE:
  - Use conversation history to personalize responses
  - Avoid repeating information already covered
  - Build on user's demonstrated knowledge level
  - Reference specific past interactions when relevant
  `,
  
  contextWindow: 4000, // Token limit for conversation history
  contextStrategy: "sliding", // How to manage context when limit is reached
})
```

### Dynamic Context Updates

Update context based on user interactions:

```typescript
agent.on("transaction", (tx) => {
  agent.updateContext(`User executed transaction: ${tx.hash}`)
})

agent.on("portfolioChange", (change) => {
  agent.updateContext(`Portfolio updated: ${change.summary}`)
})
```

### Context Prioritization

Manage context when approaching limits:

```typescript
const agent = new Agent({
  contextStrategy: {
    type: "priority",
    priorities: {
      userPreferences: 1.0,
      recentTransactions: 0.8,
      portfolioState: 0.7,
      generalConversation: 0.3,
    }
  }
})
```

## Agent Runtime Extensions and Custom Contexts

### Custom Context Providers

Create specialized context providers:

```typescript
class PortfolioContextProvider {
  async getContext(userId: string) {
    const portfolio = await this.getPortfolio(userId)
    return {
      totalValue: portfolio.totalValue,
      topHoldings: portfolio.topHoldings.slice(0, 5),
      riskScore: portfolio.riskScore,
      lastUpdate: portfolio.lastUpdate,
    }
  }
}

const agent = new Agent({
  contextProviders: [
    new PortfolioContextProvider(),
    new MarketDataProvider(),
    new TransactionHistoryProvider(),
  ]
})
```

### Runtime Context Updates

Update agent context during runtime:

```typescript
// Update context based on market conditions
agent.updateContext("market", {
  trend: "bullish",
  volatility: "high",
  majorEvents: ["ETH upgrade", "Fed announcement"],
})

// Update context based on user actions
agent.updateContext("user", {
  riskTolerance: "moderate",
  experienceLevel: "intermediate",
  preferredProtocols: ["Uniswap", "Aave", "Compound"],
})
```

### Conditional Instructions

Adapt instructions based on context:

```typescript
const agent = new Agent({
  instructions: `
  BASE INSTRUCTIONS: You are a DeFi assistant.
  
  CONDITIONAL BEHAVIOR:
  
  IF user.experienceLevel === "beginner":
    - Provide detailed explanations for all concepts
    - Suggest starting with simple, low-risk protocols
    - Include educational resources in responses
    - Ask if they need clarification frequently
  
  IF user.experienceLevel === "advanced":
    - Focus on advanced strategies and optimizations
    - Provide technical details and data
    - Suggest complex multi-protocol strategies
    - Assume familiarity with DeFi concepts
  
  IF market.volatility === "high":
    - Emphasize risk management
    - Suggest reducing position sizes
    - Recommend stable, established protocols
    - Warn about potential liquidation risks
  `,
})
```

### Extension Hooks

Create hooks for runtime behavior modification:

```typescript
agent.addHook("beforeResponse", async (context) => {
  // Add market sentiment to all responses
  const sentiment = await getMarketSentiment()
  context.marketSentiment = sentiment
  return context
})

agent.addHook("afterTransaction", async (transaction) => {
  // Update user risk profile after transactions
  await updateUserRiskProfile(transaction.userId, transaction)
})
```

## Advanced Prompting Techniques

### Chain of Thought Prompting

Encourage step-by-step reasoning:

```typescript
const instructions = `
When analyzing complex DeFi strategies, use this thought process:

1. UNDERSTAND: What is the user trying to achieve?
2. ANALYZE: What are the current market conditions?
3. EVALUATE: What are the available options and their trade-offs?
4. RECOMMEND: What is the best course of action and why?
5. RISK ASSESS: What could go wrong and how to mitigate?
6. EXECUTE: What are the specific steps to implement?

Always show your reasoning process to help users learn.
`
```

### Few-Shot Examples

Provide examples of desired behavior:

```typescript
const instructions = `
Here are examples of how to respond to common requests:

USER: "Should I buy more ETH?"
GOOD RESPONSE: "I can help you analyze this decision. First, let me check your current portfolio allocation and recent ETH performance. Based on your portfolio, you currently hold X% in ETH. Recent market data shows... Given your risk tolerance of [level], I'd suggest..."

USER: "What's the best yield farming opportunity?"
GOOD RESPONSE: "Let me analyze current yield farming opportunities based on your criteria. I'll evaluate: 1) APY rates, 2) Protocol security, 3) Impermanent loss risk, 4) Lock-up periods. Here are the top 3 options with their risk/reward profiles..."

Always follow this pattern: acknowledge → analyze → recommend → explain risks.
`
```

### Error Handling Instructions

Define how to handle errors and edge cases:

```typescript
const instructions = `
ERROR HANDLING:

WHEN transaction fails:
- Explain what went wrong in simple terms
- Suggest specific solutions (gas price, slippage, etc.)
- Offer to retry with adjusted parameters
- Provide alternative approaches if needed

WHEN data is unavailable:
- Acknowledge the limitation clearly
- Explain what data is missing and why
- Suggest alternative sources or approaches
- Provide best estimates with appropriate caveats

WHEN user request is unclear:
- Ask specific clarifying questions
- Provide examples of what you can help with
- Break down complex requests into smaller parts
- Confirm understanding before proceeding
`
